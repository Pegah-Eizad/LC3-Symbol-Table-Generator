# LC3-Symbol-Table-Generator
Python program to generate a symbol table for an LC3 program

By Pegah Eizadkhah
PYTHON SYMBOL TABLE PROJECT

This scalable Python program runs on a correct LC3 (machine larning language) input file given by the user and retrieves
the labels (LC3 keywords) in the files along with their address and puts them in a
symbol table and displays it for the user. In addition the user can retrieve the
address of a label from the symbol table by specifying the label. The program uses 
a tuple list (dictionary) to store the data from the input file. 

****************************************************************

Run the module.
The program will ask for the name of your LC3 input file. Since the python program is scalable, this LC3 program can vary in length but should be formatted like the sample below (also see lc3_program_input.txt):
<br></br>

<br></br>
The program will then ask if the user would like to look up the address of a label. 
if so, press y or type in 'yes', and the result will be displayed. 
If not, press any other other key and the program terminates.
