Python program to generate a symbol table for an LC3 program

PYTHON SYMBOL TABLE PROJECT

This scalable Python program runs on a correct LC3 (machine larning language) input file given by the user and retrieves
the labels (LC3 keywords) in the files along with their address and puts them in a
symbol table and displays it for the user. In addition the user can retrieve the
address of a label from the symbol table by specifying the label. The program uses 
a tuple list (dictionary) to store the data from the input file.
